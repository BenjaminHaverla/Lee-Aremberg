# Lee Arenberg (American actor) – beautiful conversation
It was an unexpected meeting for me. When I saw him, I remembered his performance in the Once Upon a Time TV series as a dwarf from Snow White. It was shocking for me to see someone who is so far from my country in real life because I was younger when I saw him on TV.

When we started to talk, he shared important advice for film directing:

1. Remember that the story has to have 3 parts: **`Beginning`** | **`Middle`**  | **`The End`**
2. Search for the (filmmaking) **`Family`** (crew) –> Search for people who will be able to go with you anywhere, like they would be willing to die for you.
3. Be courageous and don't be afraid  **`to cross the lines`**. (both in life and locations)

I was often the listener. I enjoyed his company, and I tried to hear about his life experiences and opinions. I remember he said nice things, like although we are all filmmakers from different nations, we are one big family. And that's true. I believe that filmmaking should be something that connects people. Without teamwork, people will not create amazing movies in our lifetimes.
