# Lee Arenberg (American actor) – beautiful conversation
It was an unexpected meeting for me. When I saw him, I remembered his performance in the Once Upon a Time TV series as a dwarf from Snow White. It was shocking for me to see someone who is so far from my country in real life because I was younger when I saw him on TV.

When we started to talk, he shared important advice for film directing

1. Remember that the story has to have 3 parts: Beginning | Middle | The End
2. Search for the (filmmaking) family (crew) –> Search for people who will be able to go with you anywhere, like they would be willing to die for you.
3. Be courageous and don't be afraid to cross the lines. (both in life and locations)
